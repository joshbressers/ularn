Building and installing ULarn:

1. Install the dependencies.  Note that ULarn MUST be built as a
   32-bit application. On x86_64 systems, this means you'll need the
   build tools and libraries for 32-bit development.

   On Ubuntu, the command is:

        sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib
        sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev:i386 libncurses5-dev:i386

2. Do the usual configure/make/make install dance:

        ./configure --prefix=<place to install ULarn>
        make
        make install    # Run with sudo if installing system-wide

   And if nothing broke, that's all you need.


Notes:

1. Ularn absolutely must be built as a 32-bit application. There are
implicit assumptions of both 32-bit ints and pointers and breaking
those will fail dramatically.

2. Ularn is ancient C code that violates the conventions and rules of
modern C in a number of ways. In particular, a) it declares functions
with no type (they default to int) and b) it returns from them with no
return value.  Both issue serious warnings and a) is illegal as of
C90, although both gcc and clang can be made to tolerate it.  The
current build scripts just disable warnings altogether, since there
are too many to actually be useful.

3. There is a common scoreboard stored in a file in the Ularn
installation.  Classic Ularn on Unix would (I *think*) prevent
cheating by creating a ularn group, making the executable setgid and
the scorefile writable by the group.  The current installer doesn't
bother with that; if you care, you can try making the changes
manually.
